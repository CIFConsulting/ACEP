# WELCOME TO THE ACEP GLOBAL DATABASE

The Bureau International des Containers et du Transport Intermodal (BIC) operates the Global ACEP Database under the guidance of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), which has encouraged all National Administrations to utilize the database for the publication of their ACEPs (see CSC.1/CIRC.143 and CSC.1/CIRC.138/REV.1).

BIC have made available the ACEP codes in Github to provide machine readable codes that systems can rely upon to be maintained and updated and used for any necessary purposes.  Registered ACEP operators can self provide the ACEP number to BIC as part of their registration process and renewal, this data is then provided publically here as well as sent to the Delivering Authority and Administration for them to verify and manage internally.

If you wish to view the ACEP numbers in a website please visit https://www.bic-acep.org or https://www.bic-code.org/acep for further information.

The Data provided here is under the ODC-PDDL-1.0? license ..
