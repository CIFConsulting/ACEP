# ACEP
An alternative to the Periodic Examination Scheme, the Approved Continuous Examination Program (ACEP) is the container inspection scheme utilized by most major ocean carriers and container lessors to ensure ongoing safety compliance of containers.   In response to container safety concerns, Administrations are now required to publish a list of all valid ACEP’s, to audit ACEP-holders on a regular basis and to renew ACEP’s every 10 years.   The Global ACEP Database was built to address these new requirements, bringing all ACEP data into one centralized database and ensuring full transparency for all concerned parties.
